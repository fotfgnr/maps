Friends of the Faerie Glen Nature Reserve: Hiking Trials and Weed control blocks.
Program : Coreldraw V13. 
Done as an A3 size overlay at scale 5000:1 with detail jpeg background from Google Earth.
This is easily scaled to the outline of the nature reserve, and then cropped to the A3 size.
The paths were traced from winter aerial photos (Google Earth 2004,2006,2008,2010,2014) , where they become very visible.
The weed control blocks are exactly 1 hectare in size, thus 100*100m.
The funny placing with extra spacing in the east-west direction is to correspond to Tshwane Nature Conservation's original map.

NEW: Aerial photo from Aug 2016, Add layer for GPS blocks, sized 111m*100m, thus 1.11Ha, to correspond to GPS coordinates.
Blocks are labled with 1/1000th degree lat and lon.
Changed some names and updated infomation.
